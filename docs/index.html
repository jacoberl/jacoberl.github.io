<h1>{{ "About Me" }}</h1>
I am a fourth year physics PhD student at UC Berkeley advised by David Nadler and Mina Aganagic. 
My research interests are topological quantum field theories, the geometric Langlands program, deformation quantization, and derived algebraic geometry, which ties these together. 
You can reach me at jacob[first three letters of my last name][at]berkeley.edu.
