<h1>{{ "About Me" }}</h1>
My name is Jacob Erlikhman, and I am a third year physics PhD student at UC Berkeley advised by David Nadler and Mina Aganagic. My research interests are topological quantum field theories, the geometric Langlands program, deformation quantization, and derived algebraic geometry, which ties these together.
