The topic for the semester is singular support of (ind-)coherent sheaves and matrix factorizations. Some references are [Arinkin-Gaitsgory 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.6343), [Arinkin-Gaitsgory 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4394), [Beraldo-Lin-Reeves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10692), and [di Fiore's thesis](https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/2022/files/diFiore_uchicago_0330D_14994.pdf).
