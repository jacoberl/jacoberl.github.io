# Derived Algebraic Geometry Student Seminar Fall 2024

The topic for the semester is singular support of (ind-)coherent sheaves and matrix factorizations. Some references are [Arinkin-Gaitsgory 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.6343), [Arinkin-Gaitsgory 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4394), [Beraldo-Lin-Reeves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10692), and [di Fiore's thesis](https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/2022/files/diFiore_uchicago_0330D_14994.pdf). We are currently meeting in **Evans 891 Tuesdays 9-11**.

If you'd like to join remotely, send me an e-mail so that I open Zoom. [Here's the Zoom link](https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/8271009900).

| Date    | Speaker | Title | Abstract|Notes|
| -------- | ------- | -------| ------|----|
|2/11| Swapnil Garg | Singular Support of Constructible Sheaves| I will review singular support of constructible sheaves and D-modules, in particular highlighting the construction of the sheaf of categories over $$T^*X$$ called $$\mu Sh_\Lambda$$, for $$\Lambda$$ a conical Lagrangian in $$T^*X$$. If time permits, I will then explain the concept of the singular support of a strong $$G$$-category $$C$$ (i.e. a $$D(G)$$-module $$C$$), which is a subset of $$Lie(G)^*$$, following Dhillon--Faergeman. | |
|2/18| Ansuman Bardalai | Singular Support of Coherent Sheaves I | I will try to define the notion of singular support of coherent sheaves (with some motivation). | | 
|2/25| Yuji Okitani | Singular Support of Coherent Sheaves II | I will discuss several methods to compute singular support of coherent sheaves. I will also try to outline the conceptual definition of singular support, following David's GRT talk from last year. | | 
|3/3| Yuji Okitani | Singular Support of Coherent Sheaves III | Continuation of previous week's talk. | | 
|3/31| Jacob Erlikhman | IndCoh as a Crystal of Categories I | I will try to explain how IndCoh(X) forms a crystal of categories on Sing(X) via the assignment N \mapsto IndCoh_N(X). More precisely, I'll focus on the (big) category of singularities IndCoh(X)/QCoh(X) as a crystal of categories on the projectivization PSing(X). | | 
|4/7| Jacob Erlikhman | IndCoh as a Crystal of Categories II | Continuation of previous week's talk. | |
|4/22| Jacob Erlikhman | $$HH_*(\mathsf{IndCoh}_{\mathscr{N}}(X)$$ | I will describe how Beraldo-Lin-Reeves are able to show that Hochschild homology of IndCoh(X) for quasi-smooth stacks X is global sections of the dualizing sheaf on the free loop space of Sing(X) by considering B-model type TQFTs associated to the category of module categories over HC(X)-mod (so one category level up from HC(X)-module categories). There is also a variant with singular support. | |
|4/29| Jacob Erlikhman | $$HH_*(\mathsf{IndCoh}_{\mathscr{N}}(X)$$ II| Continuation of previous week's talk. | |
