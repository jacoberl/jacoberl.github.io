# Derived Algebraic Geometry Student Seminar Fall 2024

The topic for the semester is singular support of (ind-)coherent sheaves and matrix factorizations. Some references are [Arinkin-Gaitsgory 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.6343), [Arinkin-Gaitsgory 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4394), [Beraldo-Lin-Reeves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10692), and [di Fiore's thesis](https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/2022/files/diFiore_uchicago_0330D_14994.pdf). We are currently meeting in **Evans 891 Tuesdays 9-11**.

If you'd like to join remotely, send me an e-mail so that I open Zoom. [Here's the Zoom link](https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/8271009900).

| Date    | Speaker | Title | Abstract|Notes|
| -------- | ------- | -------| ------|----|
|2/11| Swapnil Garg | Singular Support of Constructible Sheaves| Tomorrow I will review singular support of constructible sheaves and D-modules, in particular highlighting the construction of the sheaf of categories over $$T*X$$ called $$\mu Sh_\Lambda$$, for $$\Lambda$$ a conical Lagrangian in $$T*X$$. If time permits, I will then explain the concept of the singular support of a strong G-category C (i.e. a $$D(G)$$-module $$C$$), which is a subset of $$Lie(G)*$$, following Dhillon--Faergeman. | |
|2/18| Ansuman Bardalai | Singular Support of Coherent Sheaves | Today I will try to define the notion of singular support of coherent sheaves (with some motivation). | |
