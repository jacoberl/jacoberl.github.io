# Derived Algebraic Geometry Student Seminar Spring 2024

Our current plan is to read the two papers [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3636) and [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.5120). We are currently meeting in Evans 959 on Tuesdays at 4 p.m. All are welcome; please e-mail me to be added to the mailing list.

If you'd like to join remotely, send me an e-mail so that I open Zoom. [Here's the Zoom link](https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/8271009900).

* 1/30: Swapnil reviewed the formalism for infinity categories as weak Kan complexes, infinity groupoids as Kan complexes, and simplicial sets and objects in various categories. He defined stacks, derived stacks, and derived schemes. Yuji worked out an example for the derived intersection of a point in the affine line. Justin reviewed monoidal Dold-Kan at the end.
* 2/6: Ansuman went through some basic examples in DAG to prepare for the proof of HKR for derived schemes (Prop 4.4 in the first paper). He gave examples of some loop space calculations, the cotangent complex for an lci map and for BG, as well as some basic examples of derived stacks, like $$S^1$$.
