# Derived Algebraic Geometry Student Seminar Fall 2024

Our current plan is to read [3d CoHA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12838). We will begin by working through [PTTV](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3209). We are currently meeting in Evans 732 on Tuesdays at 10 a.m. All are welcome; please e-mail me to be added to the mailing list.

If you'd like to join remotely, send me an e-mail so that I open Zoom. [Here's the Zoom link](https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/8271009900).
