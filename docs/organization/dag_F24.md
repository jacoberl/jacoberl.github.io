# Derived Algebraic Geometry Student Seminar Fall 2024

Our current plan is to read [3d CoHA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12838). We will begin by working through [PTTV](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3209). We are currently meeting in Evans 732 on Tuesdays at 10 a.m. All are welcome; please e-mail me to be added to the mailing list.

If you'd like to join remotely, send me an e-mail so that I open Zoom. [Here's the Zoom link](https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/8271009900).

| Date    | Speaker | Title | Abstract|Notes|
| -------- | ------- | -------| ------|----|
| 9/17  | John Nolan | A brief overview of DAG and shifted symplectic structures| I'll begin by giving a (very quick) summary of derived algebraic geometry and why new / prospective members might find it useful. After that, I'll give a partial definition of shifted symplectic structures, and I'll discuss some contexts in which shifted symplectic geometry plays a significant role. This talk will be relatively non-technical, and hopefully future talks will fill in the (important) details I omit.|[PDF](https://jacoberl.github.io/assets/dag-seminar/DAG%20Sep%2017%2C%202024.pdf)
|9/24 | Justin Wu | Shifted Symplectic Structures| I will go into detail about shifted symplectic structures, and give some examples. Then I will discuss lagrangian correspondences and a Darboux theorem for (-1)-shifted symplectic stacks.| |
| 10/1 | Yuji Okitani | Examples of Lagrangians | 
I will be talking tomorrow (and asking questions) about some examples of Lagrangians from https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3235, and also about the loop space interpretation of the spaces introduced last week.| |
|10/8 | Chris Li | | | |
