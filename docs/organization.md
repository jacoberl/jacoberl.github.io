# Derived Algebraic Geometry Student Seminar Fall 2023

Our current plan is to read [Toen's survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1044). We are currently meeting in Evans 740 on Tuesdays at 9 a.m. All are welcome; please e-mail me to be added to the mailing list.

If you'd like to join remotely, send me an e-mail so that I open Zoom. [Here's the Zoom link.](https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/8271009900).

* 8/3: Formulated the plan and discussed how to compute homotopy (co)fibers in the category of chain complexes (with the projective model structure).
* 8/10: Discussed Illusie's cotangent complex and did some simple calculations with it. Figured out the relation between Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch and virtual fundamental classes. This still corresponds to Section 1 of the survey.
* 8/17: Formulation of deformation theory as a functor out of a category of local Artin rings following [Schlessinger](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1994967). Also Section 1 of the survey.
* 8/24: Discussed model categories, focusing on the main examples of topological spaces and chain complexes. This is Section 2 of the survey. Resources: [Mazel-Gee's Notes](https://etale.site/teaching/s23-128/math-128-s23-lecture-notes.pdf) and [Sophie Morel's Notes](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~smorel/notes540.pdf).
* 8/29: Discussed construction of quasi-categoies via the horn-filling property, i.e. via weak Kan complexes. Also discussed Kan complexes. Supplemental to section 2 of the survey.
* 9/5: Gave some examples of infinity categories via Top and Ch. Discussed homotopy pullbacks and pushouts in these categories, and how to pass from Top to Ch via the chains functor.
* 9/12: Discussed stacks, descent, BG as a (truncated) stack, Cech nerves, prestacks, and derived schemes. Section 2 of the survey.
* 9/19: Discussed quasi-coherent shaves on prestacks, the cotangent complex of a prestack, tangent spaces/complexes (on locally almost of finite type prestacks), and geometric n-stacks, also known as Artin n-stacks. Section 3.1 of the survey.
* 9/26: Yuji led us through a calculation of the self-intersection of a point in the affine line, a calculation of the blowup of the affine plane at the origin along with a calculation of the derived fiber, a general construction of the cotangent complex for categories with abelian group objects, and a discussion of non-flat base change in classical algebraic geometry and how it relates to the derived setting.

* 10/3: Justin covered monoidal Dold Kan, comparison between simplicial commutative algebras, dgas, and $\mathbb{E}_\infty$ algebras, and a computation of cotangent complex of a quotient stack  $L_U/G = \text{Fib}(L_U \to f^* g^*)$.

* 10/10: **Justin** is speaking about _something else_ from Section 3 of the survey!
