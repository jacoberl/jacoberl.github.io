# Derived Algebraic Geometry Student Seminar Fall 2023

Our current plan is to read [Toen's survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1044). We are currently meeting in Evans 762 on Tuesdays at 2:30. All are welcome; please e-mail me to be added to the mailing list.

If you'd like to join remotely, [here's the Zoom link.](https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/8271009900)

* 8/3: Formulated the plan and discussed how to compute homotopy (co)fibers in the category of chain complexes (with the projective model structure).
* 8/10: Discussed Illusie's cotangent complex and did some simple calculations with it. Figured out the relation between Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch and virtual fundamental classes. This still corresponds to Section 1 of the survey.
* 8/17: Formulation of deformation theory as a functor out of a category of local Artin rings following [Schlessinger](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1994967). Also Section 1 of the survey.
* 8/24: Discussed model categories, focusing on the main examples of topological spaces and chain complexes. Resources: [Mazel-Gee's Notes](https://etale.site/teaching/s23-128/math-128-s23-lecture-notes.pdf) and [Sophie Morel's Notes](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~smorel/notes540.pdf)
* 8/29: Plan to discuss infinity categories and the simplicial homotopy coherent nerve construction.
